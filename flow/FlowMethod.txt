Minimum vertex cover on bipartite graph =
Maximum matching on bipartite graph

Minimum edge cover on bipartite graph =
vertex number - Minimum vertex cover(Maximum matching)

Independent set on bipartite graph =
vertex number - Minimum vertex cover(Maximum matching)

找出最小點覆蓋，做完dinic之後，從源點dfs只走還有流量的
邊，左邊沒被走到的點跟右邊被走到的點就是答案，其他點為最大獨立集

Maximum density subgraph ( \sum W_e + \sum W_v ) / |V|

Binary search on answer:
For a fixed D, construct a Max flow model as follow:
Let S be Sum of all weight( or inf)
1. from source to each node with cap = S
2. For each (u,v,w) in E, (u->v,cap=w), (v->u,cap=w)
3. For each node v, from v to sink with cap = S + 2 * D - deg[v] - 2 * (W of v)
where deg[v] = \sum weight of edge associated with v
If maxflow < S * |V|, D is an answer.

Requiring subgraph: all vertex can be reached from source with
edge whose cap > 0.
